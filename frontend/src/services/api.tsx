    description: "The module consists of 4 different projects. Three of them involves developing some kind of application. The other one is seminar presentation and mutual critique of an existing application on the market. Grading is 100% continuous assessment, based on projects and participation through blogging. The workload is extremely heavy so you will probably have very little time to spend on other modules. There are no formal lectures, almost all lectures are guest lectures. They cover a diverse range of topics from idea validation, growth hacking to security practices and database scaling.",
